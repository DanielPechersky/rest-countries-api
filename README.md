## My process

### Built with

- Svelte
- Tailwind
- Typescript
- Font Awesome Icons

### What I learned

- I familiarized myself with Svelte.
- I learned how to make a fully client-side website, which is a departure from my experience as a Rails developer.
- I improved my intuition around CSS layouts.
- I learned how to implement small details like a magnifying glass icon in a search bar.
- I learned how to continuously deploy a Github Pages website.

### Continued development

I'd like to learn more about design, error robustness in SPAs, internationalization, and accessibility.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - For documentation of HTML/CSS.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - For tailwind classes. Easy to search.
